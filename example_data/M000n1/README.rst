params.m000n1.ini: Param file for generating initial conditions for 
	M000n1 simulation. Note that the amplitude of this file is not 
	correct for sigma8 = 0.8, which is how the parameters were defined. 
	This is ok for the simulation since the amplitude was calculated 
	externally. The correct value of the scalar amplitude is 4.09e-9.

Transfer function files: The names of these may be found in the params file 
	above. The transfer functions were output at redshifts of 0 (fin), 
	1.006 (247) and 2.018 (163)
